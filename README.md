# Espresso-Express
This is a simple command-line coffee machine simulator built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The project mimics a real-world coffee vending machine where users can order drinks like **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino**, insert virtual coins, and get feedback on resources and change.
