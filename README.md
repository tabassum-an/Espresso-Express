# Espresso-Express
This is a simple command-line coffee machine simulator built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The project mimics a real-world coffee vending machine where users can order drinks like **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino**, insert virtual coins, and get feedback on resources and change.


🚀 Features

- Object-oriented design with `Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, and `MoneyMachine` classes.
- Coin processing and change calculation.
- Inventory/resource management.
- Maintenance mode to refill ingredients.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.
- Error handling for invalid input and insufficient funds/resources.


🚀 Follow the on-screen prompts:

- Type espresso, latte, or cappuccino to make a drink.
- Type report to check resources and profit.
- Type maintenance to refill resources.
- Type off to shut down the machine.
